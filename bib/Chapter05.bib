  title={RatSLAM: a hippocampal model for simultaneous localization and mapping},
  author={Milford, Michael J and Wyeth, Gordon F and Prasser, David},
  abstract={The work presents a new approach to the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping - SLAM - inspired by computational models of the hippocampus of rodents. The rodent hippocampus has been extensively studied with respect to navigation tasks, and displays many of the properties of a desirable SLAM solution. RatSLAM is an implementation of a hippocampal model that can perform SLAM in real time on a real robot. It uses a competitive attractor network to integrate odometric information with landmark sensing to form a consistent representation of the environment. Experimental results show that RatSLAM can operate with ambiguous landmark information and recover from both minor and major path integration errors.

  title={Vision-based place recognition: how low can you go?},
  abstract={In this paper we use the algorithm SeqSLAM to address the question, how little and what quality of visual information is
needed to localize along a familiar route? We conduct a comprehensive investigation of place recognition performance
on seven datasets while varying image resolution (primarily 1 to 512 pixel images), pixel bit depth, field of view, motion
blur, image compression and matching sequence length. Results confirm that place recognition using single images or
short image sequences is poor, but improves to match or exceed current benchmarks as the matching sequence length
increases. We then present place recognition results from two experiments where low-quality imagery is directly caused
by sensor limitations; in one, place recognition is achieved along an unlit mountain road by using noisy, long-exposure
blurred images, and in the other, two single pixel light sensors are used to localize in an indoor environment. We also
show failure modes caused by pose variance and sequence aliasing, and discuss ways in which they may be overcome. By
showing how place recognition along a route is feasible even with severely degraded image sequences, we hope to provoke
a re-examination of how we develop and test future localization and mapping systems.},

@article{maddern2012cat,
  title={CAT-SLAM: probabilistic localisation and mapping using a continuous appearance-based trajectory},
  author={Maddern, Will and Milford, Michael and Wyeth, Gordon},
  abstract={This paper describes a new system, dubbed Continuous Appearance-based Trajectory Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (CAT-SLAM), which augments sequential appearance-based place recognition with local metric pose filtering
to improve the frequency and reliability of appearance-based loop closure. As in other approaches to appearance-based
mapping, loop closure is performed without calculating global feature geometry or performing 3D map construction.
Loop-closure filtering uses a probabilistic distribution of possible loop closures along the robot’s previous trajectory, which
is represented by a linked list of previously visited locations linked by odometric information. Sequential appearance-based
place recognition and local metric pose filtering are evaluated simultaneously using a Rao–Blackwellised particle filter,
which weights particles based on appearance matching over sequential frames and the similarity of robot motion along
the trajectory. The particle filter explicitly models both the likelihood of revisiting previous locations and exploring new
locations. A modified resampling scheme counters particle deprivation and allows loop-closure updates to be performed
in constant time for a given environment. We compare the performance of CAT-SLAM with FAB-MAP (a state-of-the-art
appearance-only SLAM algorithm) using multiple real-world datasets, demonstrating an increase in the number of correct
loop closures detected by CAT-SLAM.},
