abstract = {Camera phones are a promising platform for hand-held augmented reality. As their computational resources grow, they are becoming increasingly suitable for visual tracking tasks. At the same time, they still offer considerable challenges: Their cameras offer a narrow field-of-view not best suitable for robust tracking; images are often received at less than 15 Hz; long exposure times result in significant motion blur; and finally, a rolling shutter causes severe smearing effects. This paper describes an attempt to implement a keyframe-based SLAMsystem on a camera phone (specifically, the Apple iPhone 3 G). We describe a series of adaptations to the Parallel Tracking and Mapping system to mitigate the impact of the device's imaging deficiencies. Early results demonstrate a system capable of generating and augmenting small maps, albeit with reduced accuracy and robustness compared to SLAM on a PC.},

abstract = {Computer vision holds great promise for helping persons with blindness or visual impairments (VI) to interpret and explore the visual world. To this end, it is worthwhile to assess the situation critically by understanding the actual needs of the VI population and which of these needs might be addressed by computer vision. This article reviews the types of assistive technology application areas that have already been developed for VI, and the possible roles that computer vision can play in facilitating these applications. We discuss how appropriate user interfaces are designed to translate the output of computer vision algorithms into information that the user can quickly and safely act upon, and how system-level characteristics affect the overall usability of an assistive technology. Finally, we conclude by highlighting a few novel and intriguing areas of application of computer vision to assistive technology.},

abstract = {Image category recognition is important to access visual information on the level of objects and scene types. So far, intensity-based descriptors have been widely used for feature extraction at salient points. To increase illumination invariance and discriminative power, color descriptors have been proposed. Because many different descriptors exist, a structured overview is required of color invariant descriptors in the context of image category recognition. Therefore, this paper studies the invariance properties and the distinctiveness of color descriptors (software to compute the color descriptors from this paper is available from http://www.colordescriptors.com) in a structured way. The analytical invariance properties of color descriptors are explored, using a taxonomy based on invariance properties with respect to photometric transformations, and tested experimentally using a data set with known illumination conditions. In addition, the distinctiveness of color descriptors is assessed experimentally using two benchmarks, one from the image domain and one from the video domain. From the theoretical and experimental results, it can be derived that invariance to light intensity changes and light color changes affects category recognition. The results further reveal that, for light intensity shifts, the usefulness of invariance is category-specific. Overall, when choosing a single descriptor and no prior knowledge about the data set and object and scene categories is available, the OpponentSIFT is recommended. Furthermore, a combined set of color descriptors outperforms intensity-based SIFT and improves category recognition by 8 percent on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and by 7 percent on the Mediamill Challenge.},

We present an online method that makes it possible to detect when an image comes from an already perceived scene using local shape and color information. Our approach extends the bag-of-words method used in image classification to incremental conditions and relies on Bayesian filtering to estimate loop-closure probability. We demonstrate the efficiency of our solution by real-time loop-closure detection under strong perceptual aliasing conditions in both indoor and outdoor image sequences taken with a handheld camera.},

abstract = {The morphological interpretation of histologic sections forms the basis of diagnosis and prognostication for cancer. In the diagnosis of carcinomas, pathologists perform a semiquantitative analysis of a small set of morphological features to determine the cancer's histologic grade. Physicians use histologic grade to inform their assessment of a carcinoma's aggressiveness and a patient's prognosis. Nevertheless, the determination of grade in breast cancer examines only a small set of morphological features of breast cancer epithelial cells, which has been largely unchanged since the 1920s. A comprehensive analysis of automatically quantitated morphological features could identify characteristics of prognostic relevance and provide an accurate and reproducible means for assessing prognosis from microscopic image data. We developed the C-Path (Computational Pathologist) system to measure a rich quantitative feature set from the breast cancer epithelium and stroma (6642 features), including both standard morphometric descriptors of image objects and higher-level contextual, relational, and global image features. These measurements were used to construct a prognostic model. We applied the C-Path system to microscopic images from two independent cohorts of breast cancer patients [from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) cohort, n = 248, and the Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) cohort, n = 328]. The prognostic model score generated by our system was strongly associated with overall survival in both the NKI and the VGH cohorts (both log-rank P ≤ 0.001). This association was independent of clinical, pathological, and molecular factors. Three stromal features were significantly associated with survival, and this association was stronger than the association of survival with epithelial characteristics in the model. These findings implicate stromal morphologic structure as a previously unrecognized prognostic determinant for breast cancer.},

abstract = {Image classification is a critical task for both humans and computers. One of the challenges lies in the large scale of the semantic space. In particular, humans can recognize tens of thousands of object classes and scenes. No computer vision algorithm today has been tested at this scale. This paper presents a study of large scale categorization including a series of challenging experiments on classification with more than 10, 000 image classes. We find that a) computational issues be- come crucial in algorithm design; b) conventional wisdom from a couple of hundred image categories on relative performance of different classi- fiers does not necessarily hold when the number of categories increases; c) there is a surprisingly strong relationship between the structure of WordNet (developed for studying language) and the difficulty of visual categorization; d) classification can be improved by exploiting the se- mantic hierarchy. Toward the future goal of developing automatic vision algorithms to recognize tens of thousands or even millions of image cat- egories, we make a series of observations and arguments about dataset scale, category density, and image hierarchy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Narrow band imaging (NBI) can accurately characterize colonic polyps using microvascular appearances. We aimed to assess whether the Kudo pit pattern classification is accurate when used with NBI (without dye-spray), and if microvascular appearances or NBI pit patterns maintain accuracy for polyp characterization at sizes < 10 mm. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 116 polyps < 10 mm in size were detected in 62 patients undergoing surveillance colonoscopy. The polyps were prospectively assessed using NBI and magnification for Kudo pit pattern (III-V neoplastic, I-II non-neoplastic) and vascular pattern intensity (VPI), a measure of microvascular density (strong VPI, neoplastic; normal or weak VPI, non-neoplastic). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated and compared with results from histopathology. RESULTS: The mean polyp size was 3.4 mm (range 1 - 9 mm). Overall, NBI pit pattern sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 0.88, 0.91, and 89.6 respectively. Equivalent values for VPI were 0.94, 0.89, and 91.4 \%. Results were similar when polyps were subdivided into diminutive polyps (size <or= 5 mm) and flat polyps. Combining both pit pattern and VPI improved the sensitivity (0.98, P = 0.06 versus NBI pit pattern alone). There was very good agreement between NBI pit pattern and VPI for prediction of dysplasia (kappa = 0.83). No evidence of a learning curve for VPI was found. The NBI pit pattern was better than the VPI at subclassifying hyperplastic from other non-neoplastic polyps (sensitivity 0.79 versus 0.56, respectively, P = 0.02), but accuracy was poor. CONCLUSION: The NBI pit pattern and VPI are both highly accurate in characterizing neoplastic colonic polyps of < 10 mm, with VPI appearing to be simple to learn. NBI has the potential to replace conventional histology for small polyps.},

He had multiple polypoid and sessile lesions which were assessed using a third generation prototype narrow band imaging (NBI) colonoscope with magnification. Selected lesions were either biopsied or resected with a combination of endoscopic submucosal dissection and endoscopic mucosal resection techniques. We correlated the pit pattern and vascular pattern intensity seen with magnification NBI with histology of both inflammatory and dysplastic lesions. Dysplastic areas showed Kudo pit patterns II, IIIL, and IV and high vascular pattern intensity. Non-dysplastic and dysplastic areas of recurrence immediately adjacent to the scar from a previous endoscopic mucosal resection site were also assessed. This is the first case report where NBI has been shown to help in DALM detection and to distinguish dysplastic from non-dysplastic mucosa in ulcerative colitis.},

The incidence increased to 83 percent for those with three or more polyps. The occurrence of proximal colonic neoplasms was not affected by the size or histologic type of the rectosigmoid polyps.

In addition, no algorithm presented in the literature has been tested on more than a handful of object categories. We present an method for learning object categories from just a few training images. It is quick and it uses prior information in a principled way. We test it on a dataset composed of images of objects belonging to 101 widely varied categories. Our proposed method is based on making use of prior information, assembled from (unrelated) object categories which were previously learnt. A generative probabilistic model is used, which represents the shape and appearance of a constellation of features belonging to the object. The parameters of the model are learnt incrementally in a Bayesian manner. Our incremental algorithm is compared experimentally to an earlier batch Bayesian algorithm, as well as to one based on maximum likelihood. The incremental and batch versions have comparable classification performance on small training sets, but incremental learning is significantly faster, making real-time learning feasible. Both Bayesian methods outperform maximum likelihood on small training sets.},

abstract = {Narrow-band imaging (NBI) is a novel endoscopic technique that may enhance the accuracy of diagnosis by using narrow-bandwidth filters in a red-green-blue (R/G/B) sequential illumination system. Magnifying endoscopy by using NBI has two distinct applications: the analysis of the surface architecture of the epithelium (pit pattern) and the analysis of the vascular network. This new technique allows a better characterization of distinct types of gastrointestinal epithelia (e.g. intestinal metaplasia in Barret's esophagus), as well as the disorganization of the vascular pattern in inflammatory disorders and the irregular pit pattern in early neoplastic lesions of the esophagus, stomach and large bowel.},

The original Caltech-101 1 was collected by choosing a set of object categories, downloading examples from Google Images and then manually screening out all images that did not fit the category. Caltech-256 is collected in a similar manner with several improvements: a) the number of categories is more than doubled, b) the minimum number of images in any category is increased from 31 to 80, c) aftifacts due to image rotation are avoided and d) a new and larger clutter category is introduced for testing background rejection. We suggest several testing paradigms to measure classification performance, the benchmark the dataset using two simple metrics as well as a state-of-the-art spatial pyramid matching 2 algorithm. Finally we use the clutter category to train an interest detector which rejects uninformative background regions.},

abstract = {A label consistent K-SVD (LC-KSVD) algorithm to learn a discriminative dictionary for sparse coding is presented. In addition to using class labels of training data, we also associate label information with each dictionary item (columns of the dictionary matrix) to enforce discriminability in sparse codes during the dictionary learning process. More specifically, we introduce a new label consistent constraint called \&x2018;discriminative sparse-code error\&x2019; and combine it with the reconstruction error and the classification error to form a unified objective function. The optimal solution is efficiently obtained using the K-SVD algorithm. Our algorithm learns a single over-complete dictionary and an optimal linear classifier jointly. It yields dictionaries so that feature points with the same class labels have similar sparse codes. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms many recently proposed sparse coding techniques for face and object category recognition under the same learning conditions.},

@article{Jordan2006,
abstract = {Methods of dimensionality reduction provide a way to understand and visualize the structure of complex data sets. Traditional methods like principal component analysis and classical metric multidimensional scaling suffer from being based on linear models. Until recently, very few methods were able to reduce the data dimensionality in a nonlinear way. However, since the late nineties, many new methods have been developed and nonlinear dimensionality reduction, also called manifold learning, has become a hot topic. New advances that account for this rapid growth are, e.g. the use of graphs to represent the manifold topology, and the use of new metrics like the geodesic distance. In addition, new optimization schemes, based on kernel techniques and spectral decomposition, have lead to spectral embedding, which encompasses many of the recently developed methods. This book describes existing and advanced methods to reduce the dimensionality of numerical databases. For each method, the description starts from intuitive ideas, develops the necessary mathematical details, and ends by outlining the algorithmic implementation. Methods are compared with each other with the help of different illustrative examples. The purpose of the book is to summarize clear facts and ideas about well-known methods as well as recent developments in the topic of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. With this goal in mind, methods are all described from a unifying point of view, in order to highlight their respective strengths and shortcomings. The book is primarily intended for statisticians, computer scientists and data analysts. It is also accessible to other practitioners having a basic background in statistics and/or computational learning, like psychologists (in psychometry) and economists.},

In order to make the SIFT-based image retrieval results better, the most fundamental improvement comes in two areas. One is the introduction of the distance between the matched keypoints, and the shorter the distance between the matched keypoints, the lower the similarity measure. The other is that the image is partitioned off into sub-images, which reduces the mismatched keypoints. Experiments demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with the traditional SIFT-based image retrieval and reveal it as a good option to image retrieval.},

abstract = {An object recognition system has been developed that uses a new class of local image features. The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds},

abstract = {In this paper, we present CoLD (colorectal lesions detector) an innovative detection system to support colorectal cancer diagnosis and detection of pre-cancerous polyps, by processing endoscopy images or video frame sequences acquired during colonoscopy. It utilizes second-order statistical features that are calculated on the wavelet transformation of each image to discriminate amongst regions of normal or abnormal tissue. An artificial neural network performs the classification of the features. CoLD integrates the feature extraction and classification algorithms under a graphical user interface, which allows both novice and expert users to utilize effectively all system's functions. It has been developed in close cooperation with gastroenterology specialists and has been tested on various colonoscopy videos. The detection accuracy of the proposed system has been estimated to be more than 95\%. As it has been resulted, it can be used as a supplementary diagnostic tool for colorectal lesions.},

abstract = {In this paper, we compare the performance of descriptors computed for local interest regions, as, for example, extracted by the Harris-Affine detector. Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context, steerable filters, PCA-SIFT, differential invariants, spin images, SIFT, complex filters, moment invariants, and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors.},

abstract = {This paper presents a simple and biologically plausible model of how mammalian visual systems could detect and identify features in an image. We suggest that the points in a waveform that have unique perceptual significance as 'lines' and 'edges' are the points where the Fourier components of the waveform come into phase with each other. At these points 'local energy' is maximal. Local energy is defined as the square root of the sum of the squared response of sets of matched filters, of identical amplitude spectrum but differing in phase spectrum by 90 degrees: one filter type has an even-symmetric line-spread function, the other an odd-symmetric line-spread function. For a line the main contribution to the local energy peak is in the output of the even-symmetric filters, whereas for edges it is in the output of the odd-symmetric filters. If both filter types respond at the peak of local energy, both edges and lines are seen, either simultaneously or alternating in time. The model was tested with a series of images, and shown to predict well the position of perceived features and the organization of the images.},

abstract = {The quest for providing tissue characterization and functional mapping during minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has motivated the development of new surgical tools that extend the current functional capabilities of MIS. Miniaturized optical probes can be inserted into the instrument channel of standard endoscopes to reveal tissue cellular and subcellular microstructures, allowing excision-free optical biopsy. One of the limitations of such a point based imaging and tissue characterization technique is the difficulty of tracking probed sites in vivo. This prohibits large area surveillance and integrated functional mapping. The purpose of this paper is to present an image-based tracking framework by combining a semi model-based instrument tracking method with vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping. This allows the mapping of all spatio-temporally tracked biopsy sites, which can then be re-projected back onto the endoscopic video to provide a live augmented view in vivo, thus facilitating re-targeting and serial examination of potential lesions. The proposed method has been validated on phantom data with known ground truth and the accuracy derived demonstrates the strength and clinical value of the technique. The method facilitates a move from the current point based optical biopsy towards large area multi-scale image integration in a routine clinical environment.},

abstract = {Since the medical management of persons with adenomatous colorectal polyps differs from that of those with hyperplastic polyps, accuracy of diagnosis is essential. Although many physicians have grown confident that their skills of visual diagnosis are adequate, few data exist to support this confidence. In order to examine the accuracy of physicians' judgments regarding colorectal polyp histology, the visual diagnosis of physicians experienced in endoscopy was compared with the histologic report. Eighty-one polyps were discovered by flexible sigmoidoscopy among 718 participants in a colon cancer screening program. Eighty percent of all polyps were detected accurately. The diagnostic sensitivity of detecting adenomas was 69 percent, while specificity (accurate diagnosis of hyperplastic polyps) was 86 percent, and there were an additional eight false negative and eight false positive diagnoses. Further analyses revealed that there are individual patterns of diagnostic mistakes made by physicians and that mistakes frequently are related to polyp size. These findings are particularly important in light of the expanding numbers of relatively inexperienced primary care providers performing flexible sigmoidoscopy whose diagnoses may be strongly dependent on polyp size.},

abstract = {Initial tissue sections from biopsies of endoscopically apparent colonic polyps may not always demonstrate a lesion to account for the clinical findings. Studies have shown that deeper sections and/or reorientation reveal lesions in 10\% to 31\% of initially nondiagnostic cases. However, many are clinically inconsequential hyperplastic or inflammatory polyps, and, thus, exhaustive efforts to identify them may not be justified. The aim of this study was to identify clinical parameters that predict the detection of adenomas in initially nondiagnostic endoscopic biopsies of colonic "polyps." We reoriented, reembedded, and obtained deeper tissue levels on 100 initially nondiagnostic biopsy specimens of clinically apparent polyps and found 9\% to contain tubular adenomas. Only 3\% of polyps smaller than 5 mm proved to be adenomas, compared with 22\% of those 5 mm or larger (P < .01). We conclude that nondiagnostic biopsy specimens of polyps measuring 5 mm or more should be further evaluated because they are more likely to represent adenomas, whereas smaller lesions are usually clinically inconsequential.},

@article{Sajda2004,
abstract = {One of the challenges faced by the visual system is integrating cues within and across processing streams for inferring scene properties and structure. This is particularly apparent in the inference of object motion, where psychophysical experiments have shown that integration of motion signals, distributed across space, must also be integrated with form cues. This has led several to conclude that there exist mechanisms which enable form cues to 'veto' or completely suppress ambiguous motion signals. We describe a probabilistic approach which uses a generative network model for integrating form and motion cues using the machinery of belief propagation and Bayesian inference. We show, using computer simulations, that motion integration can be mediated via a local, probabilistic representation of contour ownership, which we have previously termed 'direction of figure'. The uncertainty of this inferred form cue is used to modulate the covariance matrix of network nodes representing local motion estimates in the motion stream. We show with results for two sets of stimuli that the model does not completely suppress ambiguous cues, but instead integrates them in a way that is a function of their underlying uncertainty. The result is that the model can account for the continuum of bias seen for motion coherence and perceived object motion in psychophysical experiments.},

abstract = {Oculomotor control in a humanoid robot faces similar problems as biological oculomotor systems, i.e. the stabilization of gaze in face of unknown perturbations of the body, selective attention, stereo vision, and dealing with large information processing delays. Given the nonlinearities of the geometry of binocular vision as well as the possible nonlinearities of the oculomotor plant, it is desirable to accomplish accurate control of these behaviors through learning approaches. This paper develops a learning control system for the phylogenetically oldest behaviors of oculomotor control, the stabilization reflexes of gaze. In a step-wise procedure, we demonstrate how control theoretic reasonable choices of control components result in an oculomotor control system that resembles the known functional anatomy of the primate oculomotor system. The core of the learning system is derived from the biologically inspired principle of feedback-error learning combined with a state-of-the-art non-parametric statistical learning network. With this circuitry, we demonstrate that our humanoid robot is able to acquire high performance visual stabilization reflexes after about 40 s of learning despite significant nonlinearities and processing delays in the system.},

abstract = {State of the art visual SLAM systems have recently been presented which are capable of accurate, large-scale and real-time performance, but most of these require stereo vision. Important application areas in robotics and beyond open up if similar performance can be demonstrated using monocular vision, since a single camera will always be cheaper, more compact and easier to calibrate than a multi-camera rig. With high quality estimation, a single camera moving through a static scene of course effectively provides its own stereo geometry via frames distributed over time. However, a classic issue with monocular visual SLAM is that due to the purely projective nature of a single camera, motion estimates and map structure can only be recovered up to scale. Without the known inter-camera distance of a stereo rig to serve as an anchor, the scale of locally constructed map portions and the corresponding motion estimates is therefore liable to drift over time. In this paper we describe a new near real-time visual SLAM system which adopts the continuous keyframe optimisation ap- proach of the best current stereo systems, but accounts for the additional challenges presented by monocular input. In particular, we present a new pose-graph optimisation technique which allows for the efficient correction of rotation, translation and scale drift at loop closures. Especially, we describe the Lie group of similarity transformations and its relation to the corresponding Lie algebra.We also present in detail the systems new image processing front-end which is able accurately to track hundreds of features per frame, and a filter-based approach for feature initialisation within keyframe-based SLAM. Our approach is proven via large-scale simulation and real-world experiments where a camera completes large looped trajectories.},

abstract = {This paper presents a fully automated method for segmenting articular knee cartilage and bone from in vivo 3-D dual echo steady state images. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets were obtained from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) pilot study and include longitudinal images from controls and subjects with knee osteoarthritis (OA) scanned twice at each visit (baseline, 24 month). Initially, human experts segmented six MRI series. Five of the six resultant sets served as reference atlases for a multiatlas segmentation algorithm. The methodology created precise knee segmentations that were used to extract articular cartilage volume, surface area, and thickness as well as subchondral bone plate curvature. Comparison to manual segmentation showed Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.88 and 0.84 for the femoral and tibial cartilage. In OA subjects, thickness measurements showed test-retest precision ranging from 0.014 mm (0.6\%) at the femur to 0.038 mm (1.6\%) at the femoral trochlea. In the same population, the curvature test-retest precision ranged from 0.0005 mm(-1) (3.6\%) at the femur to 0.0026 mm(-1) (11.7\%) at the medial tibia. Thickness longitudinal changes showed OA Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.94 for the femur. In conclusion, the fully automated segmentation methodology produces reproducible cartilage volume, thickness, and shape measurements valuable for the study of OA progression.},

@article{Thun2010,
abstract = {Despite decreases in the cancer death rates in high-resource countries, such as the USA, the number of cancer cases and deaths is projected to more than double worldwide over the next 20-40 years. Cancer is now the third leading cause of death, with >12 million new cases and 7.6 million cancer deaths estimated to have occurred globally in 2007. By 2030, it is projected that there will be approximately 26 million new cancer cases and 17 million cancer deaths per year. The projected increase will be driven largely by growth and aging of populations and will be largest in low- and medium-resource countries. Under current trends, increased longevity in developing countries will nearly triple the number of people who survive to age 65 by 2050. This demographic shift is compounded by the entrenchment of modifiable risk factors such as smoking and obesity in many low-and medium-resource countries and by the slower decline in cancers related to chronic infections (especially stomach, liver and uterine cervix) in economically developing than in industrialized countries. This paper identifies several preventive measures that offer the most feasible approach to mitigate the anticipated global increase in cancer in countries that can least afford it. Foremost among these are the need to strengthen efforts in international tobacco control and to increase the availability of vaccines against hepatitis B and human papilloma virus in countries where they are most needed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Chromoendoscopy in combination with magnifying endoscopy is useful in distinguishing neoplastic from non-neoplastic colorectal polyps. Narrow band imaging (NBI) has been developed as a new technique to differentiate tissue patterns in vivo. The aim of the present study was to directly compare the diagnostic values of chromoendoscopy and NBI for the differentiation of neoplastic from non-neoplastic colorectal polyps. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 200 colorectal polyps from 99 patients were distributed in a 1 : 1 ratio in order to analyze the surface according to the pit pattern classification and vascular patterns by either magnifying chromoendoscopy or NBI magnification. Histologic analysis was performed on all lesions. RESULTS: Using the Kudo classification of mucosal patterns, NBI with magnification resulted in a sensitivity of 90.5 \% and a specificity of 89.2 \% for the differentiation of neoplastic vs. non-neoplastic lesions. This performance was comparable to magnifying chromoendoscopy with a sensitivity of 91.7 \% and a specificity of 90 respectively. Using vascular patterns for differentiation, NBI with magnification correctly identified 93.7 \% of neoplastic polyps and 89.2 \% of non-neoplastic colorectal lesions, whereas magnifying chromoendoscopy had a specificity of 95 \% but a sensitivity of only 66.7 \%. CONCLUSION: NBI in combination with magnifying endoscopy is a promising tool for the differentiation of neoplastic from non-neoplastic colorectal polyps in vivo without the necessity of using dye. The detection of capillary vessels with NBI allows the evaluation of colorectal lesions based on the vascular patterns with high diagnostic accuracy.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a local image descriptor, DAISY, which is very efficient to compute densely. We also present an EM-based algorithm to compute dense depth and occlusion maps from wide-baseline image pairs using this descriptor. This yields much better results in wide-baseline situations than the pixel and correlation-based algorithms that are commonly used in narrow-baseline stereo. Also, using a descriptor makes our algorithm robust against many photometric and geometric transformations. Our descriptor is inspired from earlier ones such as SIFT and GLOH but can be computed much faster for our purposes. Unlike SURF, which can also be computed efficiently at every pixel, it does not introduce artifacts that degrade the matching performance when used densely. It is important to note that our approach is the first algorithm that attempts to estimate dense depth maps from wide-baseline image pairs, and we show that it is a good one at that with many experiments for depth estimation accuracy, occlusion detection, and comparing it against other descriptors on laser-scanned ground truth scenes. We also tested our approach on a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes with different photometric and geometric transformations and our experiments support our claim to being robust against these.},

abstract = {Image category recognition is important to access visual information on the level of objects and scene types. So far, intensity-based descriptors have been widely used for feature extraction at salient points. To increase illumination invariance and discriminative power, color descriptors have been proposed. Because many different descriptors exist, a structured overview is required of color invariant descriptors in the context of image category recognition. Therefore, this paper studies the invariance properties and the distinctiveness of color descriptors (software to compute the color descriptors from this paper is available from http://www.colordescriptors.com) in a structured way. The analytical invariance properties of color descriptors are explored, using a taxonomy based on invariance properties with respect to photometric transformations, and tested experimentally using a data set with known illumination conditions. In addition, the distinctiveness of color descriptors is assessed experimentally using two benchmarks, one from the image domain and one from the video domain. From the theoretical and experimental results, it can be derived that invariance to light intensity changes and light color changes affects category recognition. The results further reveal that, for light intensity shifts, the usefulness of invariance is category-specific. Overall, when choosing a single descriptor and no prior knowledge about the data set and object and scene categories is available, the OpponentSIFT is recommended. Furthermore, a combined set of color descriptors outperforms intensity-based SIFT and improves category recognition by 8 percent on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and by 7 percent on the Mediamill Challenge.},

abstract = {Maji and Berg have recently introduced an explicit feature map approximating the intersection kernel. This enables efficient learning methods for linear kernels to be applied to the non-linear intersection kernel, expanding the applicability of this model to much larger problems. In this paper we generalize this idea, and analyse a large family of additive kernels, called homogeneous, in a unified framework. The family includes the intersection, Hellinger's, and \&amp;\#x03C7;<sup>2</sup> kernels commonly employed in computer vision. Using the framework we are able to: (i) provide explicit feature maps for all homogeneous additive kernels along with closed form expression for all common kernels; (ii) derive corresponding approximate finite-dimensional feature maps based on the Fourier sampling theorem; and (iii) quantify the extent of the approximation. We demonstrate that the approximations have indistinguishable performance from the full kernel on a number of standard datasets, yet greatly reduce the train/test times of SVM implementations. We show that the \&amp;\#x03C7;<sup>2</sup> kernel, which has been found to yield the best performance in most applications, also has the most compact feature representation. Given these train/test advantages we are able to obtain a significant performance improvement over current state of the art results based on the intersection kernel.},

@article{Zandt2007,
abstract = {In 1999, the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry committed to major restructuring of its undergraduate medical school curriculum. A distinguishing feature of this reform was the planned emphasis on and integration of several core topics or themes throughout the 4 years of the curriculum. One of these curricular themes was aging. The faculty in geriatrics was presented with an unparalleled opportunity to develop a geriatrics curriculum of major proportions through the development of an aging theme. Through a user's guide approach based on the authors' experience to date, this article identifies the 10 steps necessary to "win the geriatric game" successfully integrating an aging theme into an undergraduate medical school curriculum. Since the initiation of the aging theme, several new courses, cases, and conferences have been added or enhanced, affecting all 4 years of the curriculum. Key operational challenges included successful engagement of course directors, tracking the actual experience of the aging theme, and evaluation of students' attainment of learning objectives and eventual career choices. The authors' experience suggests that an aging theme can successfully enhance the geriatrics curricular content of undergraduate education and strongly affect students across all 4 years. This 10-step approach may serve as a model for other universities committed to integrating geriatrics across the full undergraduate medical curriculum.},

We present an online method that makes it possible to detect when an image comes from an already perceived scene using local shape and color information. Our approach extends the bag-of-words method used in image classification to incremental conditions and relies on Bayesian filtering to estimate loop-closure probability. We demonstrate the efficiency of our solution by real-time loop-closure detection under strong perceptual aliasing conditions in both indoor and outdoor image sequences taken with a handheld camera.},

abstract = {The morphological interpretation of histologic sections forms the basis of diagnosis and prognostication for cancer. In the diagnosis of carcinomas, pathologists perform a semiquantitative analysis of a small set of morphological features to determine the cancer's histologic grade. Physicians use histologic grade to inform their assessment of a carcinoma's aggressiveness and a patient's prognosis. Nevertheless, the determination of grade in breast cancer examines only a small set of morphological features of breast cancer epithelial cells, which has been largely unchanged since the 1920s. A comprehensive analysis of automatically quantitated morphological features could identify characteristics of prognostic relevance and provide an accurate and reproducible means for assessing prognosis from microscopic image data. We developed the C-Path (Computational Pathologist) system to measure a rich quantitative feature set from the breast cancer epithelium and stroma (6642 features), including both standard morphometric descriptors of image objects and higher-level contextual, relational, and global image features. These measurements were used to construct a prognostic model. We applied the C-Path system to microscopic images from two independent cohorts of breast cancer patients [from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) cohort, n = 248, and the Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) cohort, n = 328]. The prognostic model score generated by our system was strongly associated with overall survival in both the NKI and the VGH cohorts (both log-rank P ≤ 0.001). This association was independent of clinical, pathological, and molecular factors. Three stromal features were significantly associated with survival, and this association was stronger than the association of survival with epithelial characteristics in the model. These findings implicate stromal morphologic structure as a previously unrecognized prognostic determinant for breast cancer.},

It is clear that screening for colorectal cancer is currently practiced by fewer than 20\% of American adults. However, a growing consensus now exists that even though we do not yet have trial data to compare precisely the various methods for screening, there is now both a compelling case for screening and a reasonable set of methods that clinicians and patients can consider. By applying the knowledge we already have, it is likely that most of the deaths from colorectal cancer in the United States could be prevented.},

abstract = {Image classification is a critical task for both humans and computers. One of the challenges lies in the large scale of the semantic space. In particular, humans can recognize tens of thousands of object classes and scenes. No computer vision algorithm today has been tested at this scale. This paper presents a study of large scale categorization including a series of challenging experiments on classification with more than 10, 000 image classes. We find that a) computational issues be- come crucial in algorithm design; b) conventional wisdom from a couple of hundred image categories on relative performance of different classi- fiers does not necessarily hold when the number of categories increases; c) there is a surprisingly strong relationship between the structure of WordNet (developed for studying language) and the difficulty of visual categorization; d) classification can be improved by exploiting the se- mantic hierarchy. Toward the future goal of developing automatic vision algorithms to recognize tens of thousands or even millions of image cat- egories, we make a series of observations and arguments about dataset scale, category density, and image hierarchy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Narrow band imaging (NBI) can accurately characterize colonic polyps using microvascular appearances. We aimed to assess whether the Kudo pit pattern classification is accurate when used with NBI (without dye-spray), and if microvascular appearances or NBI pit patterns maintain accuracy for polyp characterization at sizes < 10 mm. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 116 polyps < 10 mm in size were detected in 62 patients undergoing surveillance colonoscopy. The polyps were prospectively assessed using NBI and magnification for Kudo pit pattern (III-V neoplastic, I-II non-neoplastic) and vascular pattern intensity (VPI), a measure of microvascular density (strong VPI, neoplastic; normal or weak VPI, non-neoplastic). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated and compared with results from histopathology. RESULTS: The mean polyp size was 3.4 mm (range 1 - 9 mm). Overall, NBI pit pattern sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 0.88, 0.91, and 89.6 respectively. Equivalent values for VPI were 0.94, 0.89, and 91.4 \%. Results were similar when polyps were subdivided into diminutive polyps (size <or= 5 mm) and flat polyps. Combining both pit pattern and VPI improved the sensitivity (0.98, P = 0.06 versus NBI pit pattern alone). There was very good agreement between NBI pit pattern and VPI for prediction of dysplasia (kappa = 0.83). No evidence of a learning curve for VPI was found. The NBI pit pattern was better than the VPI at subclassifying hyperplastic from other non-neoplastic polyps (sensitivity 0.79 versus 0.56, respectively, P = 0.02), but accuracy was poor. CONCLUSION: The NBI pit pattern and VPI are both highly accurate in characterizing neoplastic colonic polyps of < 10 mm, with VPI appearing to be simple to learn. NBI has the potential to replace conventional histology for small polyps.},

He had multiple polypoid and sessile lesions which were assessed using a third generation prototype narrow band imaging (NBI) colonoscope with magnification. Selected lesions were either biopsied or resected with a combination of endoscopic submucosal dissection and endoscopic mucosal resection techniques. We correlated the pit pattern and vascular pattern intensity seen with magnification NBI with histology of both inflammatory and dysplastic lesions. Dysplastic areas showed Kudo pit patterns II, IIIL, and IV and high vascular pattern intensity. Non-dysplastic and dysplastic areas of recurrence immediately adjacent to the scar from a previous endoscopic mucosal resection site were also assessed. This is the first case report where NBI has been shown to help in DALM detection and to distinguish dysplastic from non-dysplastic mucosa in ulcerative colitis.},

The incidence increased to 83 percent for those with three or more polyps. The occurrence of proximal colonic neoplasms was not affected by the size or histologic type of the rectosigmoid polyps.

In addition, no algorithm presented in the literature has been tested on more than a handful of object categories. We present an method for learning object categories from just a few training images. It is quick and it uses prior information in a principled way. We test it on a dataset composed of images of objects belonging to 101 widely varied categories. Our proposed method is based on making use of prior information, assembled from (unrelated) object categories which were previously learnt. A generative probabilistic model is used, which represents the shape and appearance of a constellation of features belonging to the object. The parameters of the model are learnt incrementally in a Bayesian manner. Our incremental algorithm is compared experimentally to an earlier batch Bayesian algorithm, as well as to one based on maximum likelihood. The incremental and batch versions have comparable classification performance on small training sets, but incremental learning is significantly faster, making real-time learning feasible. Both Bayesian methods outperform maximum likelihood on small training sets.},

abstract = {We introduce a challenging set of 256 object categories containing a total of 30607 images. The original Caltech-101 1 was collected by choosing a set of object categories, downloading examples from Google Images and then manually screening out all images that did not fit the category. Caltech-256 is collected in a similar manner with several improvements: a) the number of categories is more than doubled, b) the minimum number of images in any category is increased from 31 to 80, c) aftifacts due to image rotation are avoided and d) a new and larger clutter category is introduced for testing background rejection. We suggest several testing paradigms to measure classification performance, the benchmark the dataset using two simple metrics as well as a state-of-the-art spatial pyramid matching 2 algorithm. Finally we use the clutter category to train an interest detector which rejects uninformative background regions.},

In addition to using class labels of training data, we also associate label information with each dictionary item (columns of the dictionary matrix) to enforce discriminability in sparse codes during the dictionary learning process. More specifically, we introduce a new label consistent constraint called \&x2018;discriminative sparse-code error\&x2019; and combine it with the reconstruction error and the classification error to form a unified objective function. The optimal solution is efficiently obtained using the K-SVD algorithm. Our algorithm learns a single over-complete dictionary and an optimal linear classifier jointly. It yields dictionaries so that feature points with the same class labels have similar sparse codes. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms many recently proposed sparse coding techniques for face and object category recognition under the same learning conditions.},

abstract = {Methods of dimensionality reduction provide a way to understand and visualize the structure of complex data sets. Traditional methods like principal component analysis and classical metric multidimensional scaling suffer from being based on linear models. Until recently, very few methods were able to reduce the data dimensionality in a nonlinear way. However, since the late nineties, many new methods have been developed and nonlinear dimensionality reduction, also called manifold learning, has become a hot topic. New advances that account for this rapid growth are, e.g. the use of graphs to represent the manifold topology, and the use of new metrics like the geodesic distance. In addition, new optimization schemes, based on kernel techniques and spectral decomposition, have lead to spectral embedding, which encompasses many of the recently developed methods. This book describes existing and advanced methods to reduce the dimensionality of numerical databases. For each method, the description starts from intuitive ideas, develops the necessary mathematical details, and ends by outlining the algorithmic implementation. Methods are compared with each other with the help of different illustrative examples. The purpose of the book is to summarize clear facts and ideas about well-known methods as well as recent developments in the topic of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. With this goal in mind, methods are all described from a unifying point of view, in order to highlight their respective strengths and shortcomings. The book is primarily intended for statisticians, computer scientists and data analysts. It is also accessible to other practitioners having a basic background in statistics and/or computational learning, like psychologists (in psychometry) and economists.},

In order to make the SIFT-based image retrieval results better, the most fundamental improvement comes in two areas. One is the introduction of the distance between the matched keypoints, and the shorter the distance between the matched keypoints, the lower the similarity measure. The other is that the image is partitioned off into sub-images, which reduces the mismatched keypoints. Experiments demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with the traditional SIFT-based image retrieval and reveal it as a good option to image retrieval.},

abstract = {Computer vision holds great promise for helping persons with blindness or visual impairments (VI) to interpret and explore the visual world. To this end, it is worthwhile to assess the situation critically by understanding the actual needs of the VI population and which of these needs might be addressed by computer vision. This article reviews the types of assistive technology application areas that have already been developed for VI, and the possible roles that computer vision can play in facilitating these applications. We discuss how appropriate user interfaces are designed to translate the output of computer vision algorithms into information that the user can quickly and safely act upon, and how system-level characteristics affect the overall usability of an assistive technology. Finally, we conclude by highlighting a few novel and intriguing areas of application of computer vision to assistive technology.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present CoLD (colorectal lesions detector) an innovative detection system to support colorectal cancer diagnosis and detection of pre-cancerous polyps, by processing endoscopy images or video frame sequences acquired during colonoscopy. It utilizes second-order statistical features that are calculated on the wavelet transformation of each image to discriminate amongst regions of normal or abnormal tissue. An artificial neural network performs the classification of the features. CoLD integrates the feature extraction and classification algorithms under a graphical user interface, which allows both novice and expert users to utilize effectively all system's functions. It has been developed in close cooperation with gastroenterology specialists and has been tested on various colonoscopy videos. The detection accuracy of the proposed system has been estimated to be more than 95\%. As it has been resulted, it can be used as a supplementary diagnostic tool for colorectal lesions.},

abstract = {In this paper, we compare the performance of descriptors computed for local interest regions, as, for example, extracted by the Harris-Affine detector. Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context, steerable filters, PCA-SIFT, differential invariants, spin images, SIFT, complex filters, moment invariants, and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors.},

abstract = {This paper presents a simple and biologically plausible model of how mammalian visual systems could detect and identify features in an image. We suggest that the points in a waveform that have unique perceptual significance as 'lines' and 'edges' are the points where the Fourier components of the waveform come into phase with each other. At these points 'local energy' is maximal. Local energy is defined as the square root of the sum of the squared response of sets of matched filters, of identical amplitude spectrum but differing in phase spectrum by 90 degrees: one filter type has an even-symmetric line-spread function, the other an odd-symmetric line-spread function. For a line the main contribution to the local energy peak is in the output of the even-symmetric filters, whereas for edges it is in the output of the odd-symmetric filters. If both filter types respond at the peak of local energy, both edges and lines are seen, either simultaneously or alternating in time. The model was tested with a series of images, and shown to predict well the position of perceived features and the organization of the images.},

@article{Mountney2009,
abstract = {The quest for providing tissue characterization and functional mapping during minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has motivated the development of new surgical tools that extend the current functional capabilities of MIS. Miniaturized optical probes can be inserted into the instrument channel of standard endoscopes to reveal tissue cellular and subcellular microstructures, allowing excision-free optical biopsy. One of the limitations of such a point based imaging and tissue characterization technique is the difficulty of tracking probed sites in vivo. This prohibits large area surveillance and integrated functional mapping. The purpose of this paper is to present an image-based tracking framework by combining a semi model-based instrument tracking method with vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping. This allows the mapping of all spatio-temporally tracked biopsy sites, which can then be re-projected back onto the endoscopic video to provide a live augmented view in vivo, thus facilitating re-targeting and serial examination of potential lesions. The proposed method has been validated on phantom data with known ground truth and the accuracy derived demonstrates the strength and clinical value of the technique. The method facilitates a move from the current point based optical biopsy towards large area multi-scale image integration in a routine clinical environment.},

abstract = {Since the medical management of persons with adenomatous colorectal polyps differs from that of those with hyperplastic polyps, accuracy of diagnosis is essential. Although many physicians have grown confident that their skills of visual diagnosis are adequate, few data exist to support this confidence. In order to examine the accuracy of physicians' judgments regarding colorectal polyp histology, the visual diagnosis of physicians experienced in endoscopy was compared with the histologic report. Eighty-one polyps were discovered by flexible sigmoidoscopy among 718 participants in a colon cancer screening program. Eighty percent of all polyps were detected accurately. The diagnostic sensitivity of detecting adenomas was 69 percent, while specificity (accurate diagnosis of hyperplastic polyps) was 86 percent, and there were an additional eight false negative and eight false positive diagnoses. Further analyses revealed that there are individual patterns of diagnostic mistakes made by physicians and that mistakes frequently are related to polyp size. These findings are particularly important in light of the expanding numbers of relatively inexperienced primary care providers performing flexible sigmoidoscopy whose diagnoses may be strongly dependent on polyp size.},

Studies have shown that deeper sections and/or reorientation reveal lesions in 10\% to 31\% of initially nondiagnostic cases. However, many are clinically inconsequential hyperplastic or inflammatory polyps, and, thus, exhaustive efforts to identify them may not be justified. The aim of this study was to identify clinical parameters that predict the detection of adenomas in initially nondiagnostic endoscopic biopsies of colonic "polyps." We reoriented, reembedded, and obtained deeper tissue levels on 100 initially nondiagnostic biopsy specimens of clinically apparent polyps and found 9\% to contain tubular adenomas. Only 3\% of polyps smaller than 5 mm proved to be adenomas, compared with 22\% of those 5 mm or larger (P < .01). We conclude that nondiagnostic biopsy specimens of polyps measuring 5 mm or more should be further evaluated because they are more likely to represent adenomas, whereas smaller lesions are usually clinically inconsequential.},

@article{Sajda2004,
abstract = {One of the challenges faced by the visual system is integrating cues within and across processing streams for inferring scene properties and structure. This is particularly apparent in the inference of object motion, where psychophysical experiments have shown that integration of motion signals, distributed across space, must also be integrated with form cues. This has led several to conclude that there exist mechanisms which enable form cues to 'veto' or completely suppress ambiguous motion signals. We describe a probabilistic approach which uses a generative network model for integrating form and motion cues using the machinery of belief propagation and Bayesian inference. We show, using computer simulations, that motion integration can be mediated via a local, probabilistic representation of contour ownership, which we have previously termed 'direction of figure'. The uncertainty of this inferred form cue is used to modulate the covariance matrix of network nodes representing local motion estimates in the motion stream. We show with results for two sets of stimuli that the model does not completely suppress ambiguous cues, but instead integrates them in a way that is a function of their underlying uncertainty. The result is that the model can account for the continuum of bias seen for motion coherence and perceived object motion in psychophysical experiments.},

abstract = {Oculomotor control in a humanoid robot faces similar problems as biological oculomotor systems, i.e. the stabilization of gaze in face of unknown perturbations of the body, selective attention, stereo vision, and dealing with large information processing delays. Given the nonlinearities of the geometry of binocular vision as well as the possible nonlinearities of the oculomotor plant, it is desirable to accomplish accurate control of these behaviors through learning approaches. This paper develops a learning control system for the phylogenetically oldest behaviors of oculomotor control, the stabilization reflexes of gaze. In a step-wise procedure, we demonstrate how control theoretic reasonable choices of control components result in an oculomotor control system that resembles the known functional anatomy of the primate oculomotor system. The core of the learning system is derived from the biologically inspired principle of feedback-error learning combined with a state-of-the-art non-parametric statistical learning network. With this circuitry, we demonstrate that our humanoid robot is able to acquire high performance visual stabilization reflexes after about 40 s of learning despite significant nonlinearities and processing delays in the system.},

abstract = {State of the art visual SLAM systems have recently been presented which are capable of accurate, large-scale and real-time performance, but most of these require stereo vision. Important application areas in robotics and beyond open up if similar performance can be demonstrated using monocular vision, since a single camera will always be cheaper, more compact and easier to calibrate than a multi-camera rig. With high quality estimation, a single camera moving through a static scene of course effectively provides its own stereo geometry via frames distributed over time. However, a classic issue with monocular visual SLAM is that due to the purely projective nature of a single camera, motion estimates and map structure can only be recovered up to scale. Without the known inter-camera distance of a stereo rig to serve as an anchor, the scale of locally constructed map portions and the corresponding motion estimates is therefore liable to drift over time. In this paper we describe a new near real-time visual SLAM system which adopts the continuous keyframe optimisation ap- proach of the best current stereo systems, but accounts for the additional challenges presented by monocular input. In particular, we present a new pose-graph optimisation technique which allows for the efficient correction of rotation, translation and scale drift at loop closures. Especially, we describe the Lie group of similarity transformations and its relation to the corresponding Lie algebra.We also present in detail the systems new image processing front-end which is able accurately to track hundreds of features per frame, and a filter-based approach for feature initialisation within keyframe-based SLAM. Our approach is proven via large-scale simulation and real-world experiments where a camera completes large looped trajectories.},

abstract = {This paper presents a fully automated method for segmenting articular knee cartilage and bone from in vivo 3-D dual echo steady state images. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets were obtained from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) pilot study and include longitudinal images from controls and subjects with knee osteoarthritis (OA) scanned twice at each visit (baseline, 24 month). Initially, human experts segmented six MRI series. Five of the six resultant sets served as reference atlases for a multiatlas segmentation algorithm. The methodology created precise knee segmentations that were used to extract articular cartilage volume, surface area, and thickness as well as subchondral bone plate curvature. Comparison to manual segmentation showed Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.88 and 0.84 for the femoral and tibial cartilage. In OA subjects, thickness measurements showed test-retest precision ranging from 0.014 mm (0.6\%) at the femur to 0.038 mm (1.6\%) at the femoral trochlea. In the same population, the curvature test-retest precision ranged from 0.0005 mm(-1) (3.6\%) at the femur to 0.0026 mm(-1) (11.7\%) at the medial tibia. Thickness longitudinal changes showed OA Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.94 for the femur. In conclusion, the fully automated segmentation methodology produces reproducible cartilage volume, thickness, and shape measurements valuable for the study of OA progression.},

@article{Thun2010,
abstract = {Despite decreases in the cancer death rates in high-resource countries, such as the USA, the number of cancer cases and deaths is projected to more than double worldwide over the next 20-40 years. Cancer is now the third leading cause of death, with >12 million new cases and 7.6 million cancer deaths estimated to have occurred globally in 2007. By 2030, it is projected that there will be approximately 26 million new cancer cases and 17 million cancer deaths per year. The projected increase will be driven largely by growth and aging of populations and will be largest in low- and medium-resource countries. Under current trends, increased longevity in developing countries will nearly triple the number of people who survive to age 65 by 2050. This demographic shift is compounded by the entrenchment of modifiable risk factors such as smoking and obesity in many low-and medium-resource countries and by the slower decline in cancers related to chronic infections (especially stomach, liver and uterine cervix) in economically developing than in industrialized countries. This paper identifies several preventive measures that offer the most feasible approach to mitigate the anticipated global increase in cancer in countries that can least afford it. Foremost among these are the need to strengthen efforts in international tobacco control and to increase the availability of vaccines against hepatitis B and human papilloma virus in countries where they are most needed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Chromoendoscopy in combination with magnifying endoscopy is useful in distinguishing neoplastic from non-neoplastic colorectal polyps. Narrow band imaging (NBI) has been developed as a new technique to differentiate tissue patterns in vivo. The aim of the present study was to directly compare the diagnostic values of chromoendoscopy and NBI for the differentiation of neoplastic from non-neoplastic colorectal polyps. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 200 colorectal polyps from 99 patients were distributed in a 1 : 1 ratio in order to analyze the surface according to the pit pattern classification and vascular patterns by either magnifying chromoendoscopy or NBI magnification. Histologic analysis was performed on all lesions. RESULTS: Using the Kudo classification of mucosal patterns, NBI with magnification resulted in a sensitivity of 90.5 \% and a specificity of 89.2 \% for the differentiation of neoplastic vs. non-neoplastic lesions. This performance was comparable to magnifying chromoendoscopy with a sensitivity of 91.7 \% and a specificity of 90 respectively. Using vascular patterns for differentiation, NBI with magnification correctly identified 93.7 \% of neoplastic polyps and 89.2 \% of non-neoplastic colorectal lesions, whereas magnifying chromoendoscopy had a specificity of 95 \% but a sensitivity of only 66.7 \%. CONCLUSION: NBI in combination with magnifying endoscopy is a promising tool for the differentiation of neoplastic from non-neoplastic colorectal polyps in vivo without the necessity of using dye. The detection of capillary vessels with NBI allows the evaluation of colorectal lesions based on the vascular patterns with high diagnostic accuracy.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a local image descriptor, DAISY, which is very efficient to compute densely. We also present an EM-based algorithm to compute dense depth and occlusion maps from wide-baseline image pairs using this descriptor. This yields much better results in wide-baseline situations than the pixel and correlation-based algorithms that are commonly used in narrow-baseline stereo. Also, using a descriptor makes our algorithm robust against many photometric and geometric transformations. Our descriptor is inspired from earlier ones such as SIFT and GLOH but can be computed much faster for our purposes. Unlike SURF, which can also be computed efficiently at every pixel, it does not introduce artifacts that degrade the matching performance when used densely. It is important to note that our approach is the first algorithm that attempts to estimate dense depth maps from wide-baseline image pairs, and we show that it is a good one at that with many experiments for depth estimation accuracy, occlusion detection, and comparing it against other descriptors on laser-scanned ground truth scenes. We also tested our approach on a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes with different photometric and geometric transformations and our experiments support our claim to being robust against these.},

abstract = {Image category recognition is important to access visual information on the level of objects and scene types. So far, intensity-based descriptors have been widely used for feature extraction at salient points. To increase illumination invariance and discriminative power, color descriptors have been proposed. Because many different descriptors exist, a structured overview is required of color invariant descriptors in the context of image category recognition. Therefore, this paper studies the invariance properties and the distinctiveness of color descriptors (software to compute the color descriptors from this paper is available from http://www.colordescriptors.com) in a structured way. The analytical invariance properties of color descriptors are explored, using a taxonomy based on invariance properties with respect to photometric transformations, and tested experimentally using a data set with known illumination conditions. In addition, the distinctiveness of color descriptors is assessed experimentally using two benchmarks, one from the image domain and one from the video domain. From the theoretical and experimental results, it can be derived that invariance to light intensity changes and light color changes affects category recognition. The results further reveal that, for light intensity shifts, the usefulness of invariance is category-specific. Overall, when choosing a single descriptor and no prior knowledge about the data set and object and scene categories is available, the OpponentSIFT is recommended. Furthermore, a combined set of color descriptors outperforms intensity-based SIFT and improves category recognition by 8 percent on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and by 7 percent on the Mediamill Challenge.},

abstract = {Maji and Berg have recently introduced an explicit feature map approximating the intersection kernel. This enables efficient learning methods for linear kernels to be applied to the non-linear intersection kernel, expanding the applicability of this model to much larger problems. In this paper we generalize this idea, and analyse a large family of additive kernels, called homogeneous, in a unified framework. The family includes the intersection, Hellinger's, and \&amp;\#x03C7;<sup>2</sup> kernels commonly employed in computer vision. Using the framework we are able to: (i) provide explicit feature maps for all homogeneous additive kernels along with closed form expression for all common kernels; (ii) derive corresponding approximate finite-dimensional feature maps based on the Fourier sampling theorem; and (iii) quantify the extent of the approximation. We demonstrate that the approximations have indistinguishable performance from the full kernel on a number of standard datasets, yet greatly reduce the train/test times of SVM implementations. We show that the \&amp;\#x03C7;<sup>2</sup> kernel, which has been found to yield the best performance in most applications, also has the most compact feature representation. Given these train/test advantages we are able to obtain a significant performance improvement over current state of the art results based on the intersection kernel.},

@article{Zandt2007,
abstract = {In 1999, the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry committed to major restructuring of its undergraduate medical school curriculum. A distinguishing feature of this reform was the planned emphasis on and integration of several core topics or themes throughout the 4 years of the curriculum. One of these curricular themes was aging. The faculty in geriatrics was presented with an unparalleled opportunity to develop a geriatrics curriculum of major proportions through the development of an aging theme. Through a user's guide approach based on the authors' experience to date, this article identifies the 10 steps necessary to "win the geriatric game" successfully integrating an aging theme into an undergraduate medical school curriculum. Since the initiation of the aging theme, several new courses, cases, and conferences have been added or enhanced, affecting all 4 years of the curriculum. Key operational challenges included successful engagement of course directors, tracking the actual experience of the aging theme, and evaluation of students' attainment of learning objectives and eventual career choices. The authors' experience suggests that an aging theme can successfully enhance the geriatrics curricular content of undergraduate education and strongly affect students across all 4 years. This 10-step approach may serve as a model for other universities committed to integrating geriatrics across the full undergraduate medical curriculum.},

  author={Milford, Michael J and Wyeth, Gordon F and Prasser, David},
  abstract={The work presents a new approach to the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping - SLAM - inspired by computational models of the hippocampus of rodents. The rodent hippocampus has been extensively studied with respect to navigation tasks, and displays many of the properties of a desirable SLAM solution. RatSLAM is an implementation of a hippocampal model that can perform SLAM in real time on a real robot. It uses a competitive attractor network to integrate odometric information with landmark sensing to form a consistent representation of the environment. Experimental results show that RatSLAM can operate with ambiguous landmark information and recover from both minor and major path integration errors.

on seven datasets while varying image resolution (primarily 1 to 512 pixel images), pixel bit depth, field of view, motion
blur, image compression and matching sequence length. Results confirm that place recognition using single images or
short image sequences is poor, but improves to match or exceed current benchmarks as the matching sequence length
increases. We then present place recognition results from two experiments where low-quality imagery is directly caused
by sensor limitations; in one, place recognition is achieved along an unlit mountain road by using noisy, long-exposure
blurred images, and in the other, two single pixel light sensors are used to localize in an indoor environment. We also
show failure modes caused by pose variance and sequence aliasing, and discuss ways in which they may be overcome. By
showing how place recognition along a route is feasible even with severely degraded image sequences, we hope to provoke
a re-examination of how we develop and test future localization and mapping systems.},

  title={CAT-SLAM: probabilistic localisation and mapping using a continuous appearance-based trajectory},
  author={Maddern, Will and Milford, Michael and Wyeth, Gordon},
  abstract={This paper describes a new system, dubbed Continuous Appearance-based Trajectory Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (CAT-SLAM), which augments sequential appearance-based place recognition with local metric pose filtering
to improve the frequency and reliability of appearance-based loop closure. As in other approaches to appearance-based
mapping, loop closure is performed without calculating global feature geometry or performing 3D map construction.
Loop-closure filtering uses a probabilistic distribution of possible loop closures along the robot’s previous trajectory, which
is represented by a linked list of previously visited locations linked by odometric information. Sequential appearance-based
place recognition and local metric pose filtering are evaluated simultaneously using a Rao–Blackwellised particle filter,
which weights particles based on appearance matching over sequential frames and the similarity of robot motion along
the trajectory. The particle filter explicitly models both the likelihood of revisiting previous locations and exploring new
locations. A modified resampling scheme counters particle deprivation and allows loop-closure updates to be performed
in constant time for a given environment. We compare the performance of CAT-SLAM with FAB-MAP (a state-of-the-art
appearance-only SLAM algorithm) using multiple real-world datasets, demonstrating an increase in the number of correct
loop closures detected by CAT-SLAM.},
