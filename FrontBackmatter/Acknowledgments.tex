\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost I would like to express sincere gratitude to my supervisor Dr Anil Anthony Bharath, for accepting me as a PhD student and for his continuous support at every stage of the PhD. I believe I am privileged as his excellence in PhD supervision went further than expert technical advice. The perseverance, hard-work culture and ambition that he instilled in me and showed me with his tireless effort are the best cure against the many insecurities that many PhD students suffer at some point during our studies.

I would also like to thank the members of the Biologically Inspired Computer Vision Group (BICV). Being surrounded by extraordinarily bright people is the richest source of motivation. In particular, I would like to thank Dr Lucas Hadjilucas for his enthusiasm and patience when passing the knowledge on many aspects of computing and servers infrastructure that have been so valuable for me. Also to Dr Ioannis Alexiou, for providing many scientific contributions that helped lay the foundations for my research and for co-authoring many of our publications so far. Also to Christoforos Charalambus, for always being there the last three years. Special thanks go to Kai Arulkumaran, with whom I share many views on how new technology and modern approaches to scientific research can have a great impact in a PhD and add incredible value to a research group. His enthusiasm  and hard-work have been a source of motivation for the late stage of my PhD. Also thanks to all the undergraduate, MSc and visiting PhD students that at some point were part of the BICV group, a source of new and fresh ideas and always willing to lend a hand with my data collection projects. I take this opportunity to sincerely acknowledge Dr Riccardo Secoli for his help and guidance at the early stages of my PhD. To him I owe becoming a Linux power user and his advice helped me define many aspects of my PhD and to find the most important priorities.

On the personal side, I am most grateful to my parents, for teaching me those values that are the way to achieve success in life. Their solid views on integrity, hard-work and education have been important pillars of my PhD, adding the motivation, strength and endurance that is needed to accomplish a PhD.

Finally I would like to thank Myriam, who greatly encouraged me to pursue a PhD, and who has given me unconditional support during these 4 wonderful years in London in which we have achieved so much. It seemed eternal, but we are almost there.
