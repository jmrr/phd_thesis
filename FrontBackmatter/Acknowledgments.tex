\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost I would like to express sincere gratitude to my supervisor Dr Anil Anthony Bharath, for accepting me as a PhD student and for his continuous support during this thesis. I believe I am privileged as his excellence in PhD supervision went further than technical advice. The perseverance, hard-work culture and ambition that he instilled in me and showed me with his tireless effort are the best cure against the many insecurities that many PhD students suffer at some point during our studies.

I would also like to thank the members of the Biologically Inspired Computer Vision Group. Being surrounded by extraordinarily bright people is the richest source of motivation. In particular, I would like to thank Dr Lucas Hadjilucas for his help and supervision during my MSc, a key contribution for my decision of applying for a PhD.
