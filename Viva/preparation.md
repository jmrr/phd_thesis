# 1. Introduction

 * *However, relying almost entirely in the use of data to solve the problem has sometimes caused the loss of perspective and very poor improvements on performance or none at all [^1].*

  I can defend this with the same arguments of [^1] but perhaps more interestingly for viva discussion is [^2]. Basically it depends on the type of problem. There are two possible situations where a model might not perform well: the **high variance** case, where the model is too complicated for the amount of data we have, leading to *overfitting*; and the **high bias** case where the model is too simple to explain the data we have, where adding more data will not help.
